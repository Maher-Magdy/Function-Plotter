# Function Plotter

Description :
This project plots an arbitrary user-entered function. Supporting only one variable (x) and { + - / * ^ . ( ) } operators.
the user must also enters the min and max values of the variable (x).

Installation :
The project is written in C++ utilizing the QT framework. QTCustomPlot an open source library for drawing on widgets is used.A python script is also used for input text evaluation. you can use the mingw64 compiler for QT to compile the source code and the python 3.7 interpreter for the evaluator script. 

All the previous source code files are compiled and tested as the executable file is included in the repo named "Function-plotter.exe" in the "executable" folder.
All needed DLLs are included in the "required dll" directory ; please place all the DLLs files in the same directory as the executable file.
